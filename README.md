## About Me
Hello! My name is Brittany Shear, and I'm based out of Los Angeles (technically Sherman Oaks), California. I grew up in Connecticut and moved to Boston to attend Emmanuel College, where I studied Writing, Editing, and Publishing. I also pursued minors in Psychology, Marketing, and Media and Communications Studies. I have a deep love for learning and am constantly pursuing knowledge - whether that means enrolling in a part-time master's degree program or falling into a Reddit rabbit hole trying to determine the optimal build for a challenge mode run of an RPG. Speaking of, I'm a lifelong gamer and built my own PC for gaming (and now, coding!) after playing on console for 20 years. I have a deep nostalgic love for Pokemon and The Legend of Zelda series, but my favorite games now include Baldur's Gate 3, Divinity: Original Sin II, and Dead by Daylight. I'm an avid reader and fantasy is my favorite genre (which may not be surprising given my favorite video games). Some of my favorite authors include N.K. Jemisin, Charles Yu, R.F. Kuang, and Sarah J. Maas. Outside of work, games, and books, I love to be active. I play in three soccer leagues and one beach volleyball league, and I'm known to join pickup games of ultimate frisbee, pickleball, and spikeball whenever I can find them! 
## Past Coding Experience
I have very minimal coding experience, so I'm excited to develop a new skillset through this course! My first job out of college was as an Editor at a digital publishing/B2B marketing startup called Aggregage. In that role, I customized weekly newsletters and updated copy on some site pages for various webinars I produced. Each of those tasks required going into our site's backend and adjusting the text, links and images referenced in HTML. I used templatized HTML blocks to create new materials. So while I've worked a little with HTML, I've never coded something from scratch. I'm looking forward to changing that this semester!
## Career Goals
I currently work as a Content Metadata QA Manager at NBCUniversal, leading a team of copy editors to ensure all of our user-facing copy (episodic loglines, series descriptions, YouTube clip titles and descriptions, marketing materials, and much more!) upholds our premium brand quality and is free from spelling and grammatical errors. I've been a part of the Metadata QA team for almost four years and a manager for one year, and while I enjoy working within the TV space, I'd eventually like to transition into the video game industry. I enrolled in the Digital Strategy master's program at UF to upskill my current skillset to make me a more competitive applicant when I eventually make that transition. I'm not sure exactly what kind of position I'd like to hold, but I have a deep passion for the written word, storytelling, and communications, so some position that would marry those interests with my expertise in metadata and taxonomy management would be ideal.
